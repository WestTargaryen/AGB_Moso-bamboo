The codes include preprocessing raw point clouds of the three stands, random forest-based classification for mixed stand of bamboo and trees, and extracted features for classification. The original data contain the raw point clouds of the three stands in PCD format. The segmented individual plants include the separated point clouds of each individual plants in the three stands. These three stands represented the three key stages of Moso bamboo intrusion into China fir forest, i.e., underground infiltration, competitive exclusion, and dominance maintenance.
