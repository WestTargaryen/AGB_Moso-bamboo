<span style="font-size: 15px;">The aim of this project is to investigate the AGB changes caused by Moso bamboo expansion. By collecting and analyzing the data of different growth stages, the dynamic relationship between bamboo expansion and AGB accumulation is revealed, which provided scientific basis for forest ecology and forestry management.
